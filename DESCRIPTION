Description: ARTIS (Aquatic Resource Trade in Species) is a global model
    and database that estimates bilateral seafood trade flows at the
    species level from 1994 to 2020. It integrates production data,
    detailed trade statistics, and biological characteristics of seafood
    products to reconstruct trade networks and infer domestic consumption.
    The model accounts for re-exports, product transformations (e.g.,
    fishmeal production), and multiple trade classification systems (HS
    codes). This package provides tools to clean, standardize, and
    allocate seafood trade and production data, and to compute consumption
    and trade-flow metrics.  Designed to support reproducible research and
    policy-relevant analysis of seafood systems.
