#' Identify species associated with fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) production.
#'
#' This function reads SAU production data and identifies species whose production is
#' allocated to fishmeal and fish oil based on user-defined thresholds. It returns
#' a list of species marked as "primary_fishmeal" for prioritization in downstream consumption.
#'
#' @param sau_fp File path to SAU production data (CSV format).
#' @param fishmeal_min_threshold_sp Minimum percentage of a species' total production
#'        (across all countries) that must be allocated to fishmeal for it to be included
#'        in the FMFO list. Default is 1.
#' @param fishmeal_min_threshold_global Minimum percentage of the global fishmeal production
#'        that a species must contribute in order to be included in the FMFO list. Default is 0.5.
#' @param fishmeal_primary_threshold Percentage of a speciesâ€™ total production that must
#'        go to fishmeal for it to be labeled as `primary_fishmeal = 1`. These species are considered
#'        to have a strong functional association with fishmeal production. Default is 75.
